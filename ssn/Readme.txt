Simple Social Network is a project demo that we have developed to show how to deal with the main challenges in developing a web application with the following technologies:
- Asp.Net Core 3.0
- Asp.Net MVC 5
- Jee 8
- Spring 5
- React 16 and Material UI
- Angular 8 and Angular Material

The application consists of a classical multi page web application plus a Singular Page Application.
There are four versions of the multi page application, respectively in Asp.Net Core 3.0, Asp.net MVC 5, Jee 8 and Spring 5, and two versions of the SPA, respectively in React 16 and in Angular 8.
